# transit-accessible-hikes

This project aims to show the user all hikes accessible by transit to them within the Lower Mainland. They can pick their starting location and the date/time that they're aiming to leave at. It uses the latitude/longitude info of different hiking trails in Vancouver, as scraped off of the vancouvertrails website. Scraping code is at https://github.com/sriramjj5/accessible-hiking-vancouver. This info is fed to the Google Maps API to get routing details such as the transit duration, departure time, arrival time etc. 

It uses Vite/Chakra UI to make front-end development a lot less of a headache.
